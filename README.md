## Files Description

- **data**: Contains match results and statistics for exemple for the Ligue 1 2023-2024 season, including team names, wins, draws, losses, goals scored, goals against, and points.

- **main.py**: The entry point of the application. It handles user input for home and away teams and calls the prediction algorithm to generate match odds.

- **requirements.txt**: Lists the dependencies required for the project, such as pandas for data manipulation.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install the required dependencies using pip:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run the application:

   ```
   python main.py
   ```

5. Follow the prompts to input the home and away teams for which you want to generate match prediction odds.

## Usage

After running the application, you will be prompted to enter the names of the home and away teams. The application will then use the historical data to generate and display the predicted odds for the match.
